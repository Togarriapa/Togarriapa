# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

From administering anesthesia to coding applications, I've gone from putting people to sleep to keeping them on the edge of their seats with my coding skills! 

As a former Operating Room Nurse, Anaesthesia Nurse, and certified Hypnotherapist, I'm excited to bring a unique perspective to the world of tech as a Junior Software Developer. 
I'm passionate about problem solving, deconstructing complex problems and working on projects that make a meaningful impact in the world.

When I'm not coding, you can find me practicing my hypnotic techniques on unsuspecting family members or trying out new recipes in the kitchen (with varying degrees of success). 

Let's connect and see how my diverse background and technical skills can contribute to your team and maybe even entertain you with some hypnosis tricks along the way!
